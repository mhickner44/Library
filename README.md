# Book Library

This project was to practice using objects and constructors to organize code. This page can add books to your library with some information about them.

A second branch was made (classLibrary) to reorganize the code but using classes instead of plain constructors.

Doing this web page I learned about     
-version control branching  
-bubbling to add events to dynamic elements and delegation of events  
-data attributes
